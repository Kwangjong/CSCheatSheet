# Programming Basics



# Data Structure
## Data Structure Basics
***Data Structure*** is a way of organizing data in a computer efficiently. Different data structures are used according to the purpose so that a computer can effectively load and store data.

***Abstract Data Type (ADT)*** is a data type described by pre-defined using user operation such as "insert data at the rear". ***ADT*** only provides what operations are defined, not how the operations are implemented. For example, ***Stack*** is a ***abstract data type***. ***Stack*** is defined by ***push()*** which inserts an element at the top of the stack and ***pop()*** which gets top-most element out of the stack.


## Array / List
***Array*** stores data in sequential order. Each element can be accessed using an ***index*** usually starting from 0.

Time Complexity:
* Indexing: O(1)
* Search: O(n) / O(log n)


## Linked List
***Linked List*** is a series of entries that stores the value and a pointer to the next entry. Each entry is called ***Node***. Physical placement of the ***Nodes*** does not have to be sequential.

Time Complexity:
* Indexing: **O(n)**
* Append/Prepend: **O(1)**
* Delete: **O(n)**

[Getting middle element of a LinkedList with unknown length](implementation/middle-of-linked-list.py)

***Singly Linked List***: each Node has only one pointer pointing to the next Node. Can only traverse in one direction.<br/>
***Doubly Linked List***: each Node has two pointers: one pointing to the next Node, another pointing to the previous Node. Can traverse in both directions.<br/>
***Circular Linked List***: "last" node of the list points to the "first" node of the list. Can traverse the list infinitely looping around the list.<br/>

## Stack
***Stack*** is an ADT that is described by Last-In-Fist-Out(LIFO) behavior. It can be implemented using both ***Array*** or ***Linked List***
* ***push()***: insert an element at the top of the stack
* ***pop()***: return and remove an element at the top of the stack

[Implementation](implementation/stack.py)

[Tracking maximum of a stack](implementation/max-stack.py)


## Queue
***Queue*** is an ADT that is described by First-In-First-Out(FIFO) behavior. It can be implemented using both ***Array*** or ***Linked List***
* ***enque()***: insert an element at the end of the queue
* ***deque()***: return and remove an element at the head of queue

[Implementation](implementation/queue.py)


## HashTable / HashMap
***Hash table*** is a data structure that stores unordered items by mapping (or hashing) each item to a location in an array (or vector). It maps a unique ***key*** to an index using a ***hash function***. Each hash table array element is called ***bucket***. A common example of a ***hash function*** uses the modulo operator.

![hash-table](img/hash-table.png)

Time Complexity:
* Indexing: **O(1)**
* Search: **O(1)**
* Insert: **O(1)**

***Collision handling***: Collision occurs when a ***hash function*** returns the same outputs for distinct keys.
* ***Chaining***: a technique where each bucket has a list of items.
* ***Open Addressing***: a technique where collisions are resolved by looking for an empty bucket elsewhere in the table.
  * ***Linear Probing***: handles collision by linearly searching the bucket starting from the key's mapped bucket.
  * ***Quadratic Probing***: handles collision by quadratically searches the bucket starting frolm the key's mapped bucket. <br/>
       f(i) = (H + c1 * i + c2 * i<sup>2</sup>) % (*tablesize*), where H is the inital bucket, c1 and c2 is a programmer-defined constants.
  * ***Double hashing***: uses two hash functions to compute bucket indices. f(i)=(h1(key) + h2(key) * i) % (tablesize).
Iterating through a sequential *i* values to obtain the desired table is called ***probing sequence***.

## Algorithm Basics
### Iterative Algorithm
An algorithm that performs number of steps repeatedly for a finite number of times. 
* Each repetition is called ***iteration***.
* Uses looping statement like ***for*** and ***while***.
* Mostly used to move through a data set like an array or a list. 


### Recursive Algorithm
An algorithm that calls itself.
* Recursive alorithm is divided into two parts: a ***recursive case*** and a ***base case***.
* ***Recursive case*** is a condition where a recursion is triggered.
* ***Base case*** is a condition that stops the recursion and evaluates the result.
* Often used in Depth First Search


## Search Algorithms
### Linear Search / Sequential Search
A very simple searching algorithm. It starts from one end checking every element until the desired element is found.
* It can be performed in an unsorted list.
* Time Complexity : **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**
```python
def LinearSearch(array, key):
  for i in range(len(array)):
    if array[i] == key:
      return i
      
  return none
```


### Binary Search
A search algorithm that repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the desired element is found or the interval is empty.
* It can only be performed in a sorted list.
* Time Complexity : **O(log n)**

[Implementation](implementation/binary-search.py)
  
  
## Sorting Algorithms
### Selection Sort
***Selection Sort*** is a comparison based algorithms. It divides the list into a sorted part and an unsorted part, and repeatedly searches the unsorted part and "select" the smallest or greates element to move from the unsorted part to the end of the sorted part.
* Optimized for small lists (fewer than 10-20elements).
* It may require many comparisions for big lists.
* Time Complexity: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**

[Implementation](implementation/selection-sort.py)


## Insertion Sort
***Insertion Sort*** is a comparision based algorithm that searches the sorted part for the next element in the unsorted list to be "inserted".
* Optimized for small lists (fewer than 10-20elements).
* It may require many comparisions for big lists.
* It may require lesser comparision compare to ***selection sort***. ***Insertion sort*** only scans as many as it need to place ith element, while **selection sort*** always scans all elements in the unsorted part. ***Insertion sort*** is typically very efficient for list that are "nearly sorted".
* Time Complexity: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**

[Implementation](implementation/insertion-sort.py)


## Quick Sort
***Quick Sort*** is a divide and conquer algorithm that recursively partitions the input into low and high parts and sorts each of those parts. A ***pivot*** is any value within the array that divide the data into low and high parts. To partition the input, All values in the low partition are less than or equal to the pivot value, and alll the values in the high partition are greater than or equal to the pivot value. The values in each partition are not necessarily sorted.
* It is fast for the most cases. **O(n log n)**.
* However, if the pivot selected is the smallest or largest element, it results an uneven partitioning. If uneven partitioning happens at every level the runtime is **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**. This rarely happens.
* Time Complexity:
  * Average: **O(n log n)**
  * Worst: **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**

[Implementation](implementation/quick-sort.py)

## Merge Sort
***Merge Sort*** is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides a list into two halves, recursively sorts each half and merges the sorted halves. Recursive partitioning happens until only one element is in the partition.
* It requires additional memory during merging process.
* It is not highly affected by the distribution of the array given.
* Time Complexity: **O(n)**
