## Algorithm Basics
### Iterative Algorithms
An algorithm that performs number of steps repeatedly for a finite number of times. 
* Each repetition is called **iteration**.
* Uses looping statement like **for** and **while**.
* Mostly used to move through a data set like an array or a list. 


### Recursive Algorithm
An algorithm that calls itself.
* Recursive alorithm is divided into two parts: a **recursive case** and a **base case**.
* **Recursive case** is a condition where the recursion is triggered.
* **Base case** is a condition that stops the recursion and evaluates the result.
* Often used in Depth First Search

## Search Algorithms
### Linear Search
* A very


binary search
